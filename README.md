# Image-Processing-to-Find-Fluid-Column-Height
Using MATLAB to measure fluid column heights with color based seperation.

The purpose of this program is to automatically calculate the height of a column filled with a colored fluid without having to physically measure anything. This is done with the aid of color seperation and the direct proportion calculation of the height of the column with respect to a standard.
