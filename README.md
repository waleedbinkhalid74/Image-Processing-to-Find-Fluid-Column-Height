# Character-Recognition-using-OCR

This project shows techniques of how to use OCR to do Character Recognition.
This project is implemented on MATLAB and uses MATLAB OCR as the basic OCR tool.
This is an academic project.
It is not the best of OCR tools that exists, but definitely gives a good idea and a great starting point for beginners.
The details of implementation, and running the code is clearely shown in my youtube channel.
